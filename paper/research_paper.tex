\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
Autonomous navigation is the ability of a robotic system to independently perceive its environment, make decisions, and safely navigate through various scenarios without human intervention.

Autonomous navigation systems are becoming increasingly essential in robotics, from warehouse automation to personal assistance robots. While traditional autonomous systems rely on expensive sensor suites like LiDAR and stereo cameras, there is a growing need for cost-effective solutions that can operate on edge devices. The high cost and computational demands of traditional sensors limit widespread adoption, particularly in resource-constrained applications where power efficiency and affordability are crucial.

This thesis presents a novel uncertainty-guided adaptive region fusion approach for monocular obstacle avoidance, designed specifically for edge computing platforms. Our system combines MiDaS depth estimation with YOLOv8 object detection through intelligent uncertainty-guided fusion, enabling robust navigation using only a single camera. By quantifying uncertainty through Monte Carlo dropout with minimal computational overhead (15\%), our approach automatically adapts to varying environmental conditions.

\vspace{1cm}\textbf{Key Performance Achievements:} The proposed method delivers \textbf{58.2\% navigation accuracy in indoor scenarios} and \textbf{72.0\% in outdoor conditions}, while maintaining critical safety performance with \textbf{4.8\% false safe rate} — representing a \textbf{41\% reduction} compared to fixed fusion methods (8.2\%). Real-time processing at \textbf{24.5 FPS on consumer hardware} (MacBook Air M1) and validated performance on edge devices (Jetson TX2: \textbf{31.4 FPS}) demonstrates practical viability.

\textbf{Technical Innovation:} Our uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout with only \textbf{15\% computational overhead} enables adaptive fusion that automatically adjusts to environmental conditions. Comprehensive evaluation across \textbf{1,192 test frames} spanning diverse scenarios validates the approach's robustness and deployment readiness for autonomous navigation applications.

\chapter{Introduction}

Autonomous navigation systems require robust perception capabilities to safely navigate complex environments while maintaining real-time performance constraints. Traditional obstacle detection approaches rely primarily on expensive sensor suites including LiDAR, stereo cameras, and radar systems. However, the growing demand for cost-effective autonomous solutions has driven research toward monocular vision-based approaches that can achieve comparable performance with significantly reduced hardware requirements.

The fundamental challenge in monocular obstacle detection lies in the inherent depth ambiguity of single-camera systems. Unlike stereo vision or LiDAR, monocular cameras cannot directly measure distance to objects, requiring sophisticated depth estimation algorithms that introduce uncertainty and computational overhead. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled impressive monocular depth estimation capabilities, but the reliability of these estimations varies significantly across different image regions and environmental conditions.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel uncertainty-guided adaptive region fusion approach that intelligently combines monocular depth estimation with object detection to create robust obstacle maps for autonomous navigation. Our system makes three key contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Uncertainty-Guided Fusion}: A novel adaptive region fusion algorithm that dynamically weights depth information and object detection based on local uncertainty estimates, improving robustness in challenging conditions.

\item \textbf{Real-Time Navigation Decisions}: A lightweight navigation decision framework optimized for real-time obstacle avoidance with comprehensive safety metrics including false safe and false unsafe rate tracking.

\item \textbf{Comprehensive Performance Analysis}: An extensive evaluation framework comparing navigation-specific metrics rather than traditional computer vision metrics, providing insights relevant to autonomous driving applications.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{3cm}The proposed system achieves navigation decision accuracy between 45--65\% while maintaining processing speeds of 20--30 FPS on consumer hardware. Most importantly, the system demonstrates a false safe rate below 5\%, meeting critical safety requirements for autonomous navigation applications.

\vspace{12pt}
The next chapter provides a comprehensive review of existing literature in monocular depth estimation, object detection, and sensor fusion techniques, establishing the foundation for our research.

\chapter{Background and Literature Review}
This research emerges from a systematic analysis of autonomous navigation solutions, with particular focus on edge device deployments. After comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches, we identified a critical need for efficient, resource-aware navigation systems. Our investigation revealed several implementation pathways, but through careful clustering and analysis of existing solutions specifically optimized for edge computing constraints, we developed a novel approach that balances performance with computational efficiency.
The methodological foundation of our work stems from a thorough assessment of current autonomous navigation projects, specifically examining their viability for edge device deployment. This systematic review led to the identification of key optimization opportunities and informed our development of a more efficient solution architecture. Our findings suggest that while multiple implementation strategies exist, the optimal approach for edge computing scenarios requires careful consideration of both computational constraints and navigation reliability.

\subsection{Monocular Depth Estimation}

The field of monocular depth estimation has undergone significant evolution, transitioning from traditional geometric approaches to modern deep learning solutions. This progression reflects a fundamental shift in how depth information is extracted from single images.

\subsubsection{Traditional Geometric Approaches}
Early methods relied heavily on handcrafted features and geometric assumptions. Saxena et~al.~\cite{saxena2009make3d} pioneered the Make3D framework, which decomposed scenes into small superpixels and used Markov Random Fields (MRF) to enforce global consistency. Their approach demonstrated several key advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: Achieved 15--20 FPS on CPU hardware
    \item \textbf{Interpretable Pipeline}: Clear geometric reasoning in depth estimation
    \item \textbf{Minimal Training Data}: Required relatively small datasets
\end{itemize}

However, these traditional methods faced significant limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Poor generalization to complex, unstructured environments
    \item High sensitivity to lighting variations and textureless regions
    \item Inability to handle dynamic objects effectively
    \item Reliance on often-violated geometric assumptions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Deep Learning Transformation}
The introduction of deep learning approaches marked a paradigm shift in monocular depth estimation. Eigen et~al.~\cite{eigen2014depth} demonstrated that CNNs could learn depth relationships directly from data, eliminating the need for hand-engineered features. Modern approaches have introduced several crucial innovations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Scale Processing}: Integration of both fine details and global context
    \item \textbf{Self-Supervised Training}: Learning without explicit depth ground truth
    \item \textbf{Geometric Consistency}: Incorporation of photometric and geometric constraints
\end{itemize}

MiDaS~\cite{ranftl2020towards} represents a significant breakthrough through its innovative mixed-dataset training strategy, achieving several key advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cross-Domain Robustness}: Consistent performance across varied environments
    \item \textbf{Real-time Capability}: 30+ FPS on modern GPUs
    \item \textbf{Scale-Aware Predictions}: Adaptive depth estimation across different scenes
\end{itemize}

However, MiDaS also presents certain challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relative depth output requiring careful calibration
    \item Resource-intensive training process
    \item Performance degradation in extreme lighting conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Uncertainty Quantification Advances}
Recent research has emphasized the importance of uncertainty estimation in depth prediction. Poggi et~al.~\cite{poggi2020uncertainty} conducted comprehensive analysis of uncertainty estimation techniques, revealing several key findings:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Epistemic Uncertainty}: Captures model uncertainty through ensemble methods
    \item \textbf{Aleatoric Uncertainty}: Models inherent ambiguity in depth estimation
    \item \textbf{Computational Trade-offs}: Balance between accuracy and inference speed
\end{itemize}

Kendall and Gal~\cite{kendall2017uncertainties} further advanced this field by demonstrating the effectiveness of Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification, providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simple Implementation}: Minimal architectural changes required
    \item \textbf{Calibrated Confidence}: Well-correlated uncertainty estimates
    \item \textbf{Efficient Inference}: Reasonable computational overhead
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Object Detection for Autonomous Navigation}

The evolution of object detection algorithms has been crucial for autonomous navigation systems, with particular emphasis on achieving real-time performance while maintaining high accuracy. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of algorithms has been at the forefront of this development.

\subsubsection{Single-Stage Detection Evolution}
YOLOv8~\cite{jocher2023ultralytics} represents the current state-of-the-art in real-time object detection, offering several significant improvements over its predecessors:

\textbf{Architectural Innovations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anchor-Free Detection}: Eliminates need for predefined anchor boxes
    \item \textbf{Advanced Backbone}: CSPDarknet with enhanced feature extraction
    \item \textbf{Efficient Head Design}: Optimized prediction layers for faster inference
    \item \textbf{Multi-Scale Processing}: Improved detection across varying object sizes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time inference (100+ FPS on modern GPUs)
    \item Improved small object detection accuracy
    \item Reduced memory footprint
    \item Better feature utilization
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Resource-Constrained Optimization}
For autonomous navigation in embedded systems, lightweight variants like YOLOv8n provide crucial optimizations:

\textbf{Design Trade-offs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network Pruning}: Reduced channel width and depth
    \item \textbf{Efficient Convolutions}: Depthwise separable operations
    \item \textbf{Quantization Support}: INT8 precision compatibility
    \item \textbf{Memory Optimization}: Reduced activation maps
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Navigation-Specific Enhancements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class-Focused Detection}: Prioritization of navigation-relevant objects
    \item \textbf{Latency Optimization}: Frame-to-detection time minimization
    \item \textbf{Confidence Calibration}: Improved reliability metrics
    \item \textbf{Safety-Critical Tuning}: Conservative detection boundaries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sensor Fusion for Obstacle Detection}

The field of sensor fusion for autonomous navigation has evolved from traditional multi-sensor approaches to more sophisticated adaptive fusion strategies. This evolution reflects both technological advances and practical deployment considerations.

\subsubsection{Traditional Multi-Modal Systems}
Conventional autonomous vehicles typically rely on expensive sensor suites. LiDAR-based systems~\cite{geiger2012we} have been the industry standard, offering several advantages:

\textbf{LiDAR Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct 3D point cloud measurements
    \item High accuracy in varying lighting conditions
    \item Robust performance in dynamic environments
    \item Precise distance measurements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{LiDAR Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prohibitive cost for widespread deployment
    \item Limited vertical resolution
    \item Performance degradation in adverse weather
    \item High power consumption
\end{itemize}

Stereo vision systems~\cite{menze2015joint} offer an alternative approach, providing:

\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lower cost compared to LiDAR
    \item Rich visual information
    \item Passive sensing capability
    \item Natural scene understanding
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex calibration requirements
    \item Poor performance in low-texture regions
    \item Limited range accuracy
    \item Sensitivity to lighting conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modern Fusion Strategies}
Recent research has focused on intelligent fusion approaches. Chen et~al.~\cite{chen2020multi} demonstrated effective camera-radar fusion with several innovations:

\textbf{Key Contributions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probabilistic Fusion}: Uncertainty-aware combination of sensors
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Weighting}: Dynamic sensor importance adjustment
    \item \textbf{Cross-Modal Learning}: Feature-level information exchange
    \item \textbf{Real-time Processing}: Efficient fusion pipeline
\end{itemize}

Wang et~al.~\cite{wang2021multi} further advanced the field through vision-LiDAR fusion:

\textbf{Technical Innovations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Early Fusion}: Feature-level integration
    \item \textbf{Attention Mechanisms}: Cross-modal feature enhancement
    \item \textbf{Geometry-Aware Learning}: 3D structure preservation
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Modeling}: Confidence-based fusion
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SLAM and Obstacle Avoidance}

The relationship between Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and obstacle avoidance represents a crucial trade-off in autonomous navigation systems. While SLAM provides comprehensive environmental understanding, real-time obstacle avoidance often demands more focused, efficient approaches.

\subsubsection{Navigation Approaches Comparison}
Modern autonomous systems utilize two primary approaches: feature-based SLAM and reactive obstacle avoidance. SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM~\cite{mur2015orb} offer precise localization and mapping but require significant computational resources. In contrast, reactive systems prioritize immediate obstacle avoidance with lower computational overhead.

\textbf{SLAM Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages}: Accurate localization, robust mapping
    \item \textbf{Limitations}: High computational cost, complex initialization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reactive Navigation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantages}: Real-time response, minimal computation
    \item \textbf{Limitations}: Local decision scope, no persistent mapping
\end{itemize}

Visual-inertial approaches like VINS-Mono~\cite{qin2018vins} attempt to bridge this gap but introduce additional hardware complexity and calibration requirements. Our approach prioritizes immediate obstacle avoidance while maintaining computational efficiency, targeting scenarios where rapid deployment and instant operation are critical.

Our approach prioritizes immediate obstacle avoidance while maintaining computational efficiency, targeting scenarios where rapid deployment and instant operation are critical. This design philosophy acknowledges the complementary nature of SLAM and reactive avoidance while optimizing for real-world deployment constraints.

\vspace{12pt}
The following chapter details our methodology, presenting the system architecture, algorithms, and implementation details of our uncertainty-guided adaptive region fusion approach.

\chapter{Methodology}

Our methodology builds on analysis of monocular navigation methods, emphasizing adaptability to edge computing. After testing fusion and uncertainty quantification approaches, we propose an adaptive region fusion framework that combines depth estimation and object detection.

The approach introduces three innovations: uncertainty-guided fusion via Monte Carlo dropout, adaptive region selection under varying conditions, and an optimized inference pipeline for edge deployment. This chapter outlines technical foundations, design choices, and implementation details enabling robust yet efficient navigation.

\subsection{System Architecture and Design Philosophy}

The system uses a modular architecture for real-time performance and accuracy in safety-critical navigation. Each component runs independently but contributes to the navigation pipeline.

\figref{fig:architecture} shows the pipeline: preprocessing, parallel depth and detection, uncertainty-guided fusion, and navigation decision generation. Parallelism ensures efficiency under real-time constraints.

\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth,height=0.85\textheight,keepaspectratio]{system_architecture.png}
\vspace{1cm}
\caption{System architecture combining depth, detection, and uncertainty-guided fusion for real-time obstacle avoidance}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The system runs at 320$\times$240 resolution, chosen to balance speed and detail. This provides real-time processing on consumer hardware with enough spatial density for reliable navigation.

\subsection{Input Processing and Video Pipeline}

\subsubsection{Video Source Management}

The \texttt{VideoSource} class in \texttt{utils/video.py} supports:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Webcam Input}: Real-time with automatic camera handling
\item \textbf{Video File}: Offline, frame-accurate playback
\item \textbf{Multi-camera}: Selection between sources
\item \textbf{Adaptive Buffering}: Thread-safe queues with frame skipping
\end{itemize}

Frame skipping adapts to computational load, ensuring stable real-time performance.

\subsubsection{Real-time Performance Optimization}

Frame timing is modeled as:

\begin{equation}
t_{frame} = t_{depth} + t_{detection} + t_{fusion} + t_{visualization}
\label{eq:frame_timing}
\end{equation}

Optimizations include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamic Monte Carlo sampling (1–2 in real-time mode)
\item Frame-level caching
\item Automatic resolution scaling
\item Component threading
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monocular Depth Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification}

\subsubsection{MiDaS Network}

We use MiDaS-small~\cite{ranftl2020towards} for efficiency on edge hardware. It produces relative depth maps with preserved spatial relations:

\begin{equation}
D_{raw}(x,y) = f_{\theta}(I_{norm}(x,y))
\label{eq:midas_forward}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Dropout}

Dropout is kept active at inference for uncertainty estimation:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Monte Carlo Uncertainty Estimation}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Image $I$, samples $N$, dropout rate $p$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Mean depth $\mu_D$, uncertainty $\sigma_D$
\STATE $depths = []$
\FOR{$i = 1$ to $N$}
    \STATE Apply dropout $p$
    \STATE $D_i = \text{MiDaS}(I)$
    \STATE $depths.append(D_i)$
\ENDFOR
\STATE $\mu_D = \frac{1}{N} \sum D_i$
\STATE $\sigma_D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum (D_i - \mu_D)^2}$
\RETURN $\mu_D, \sigma_D$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

High uncertainty highlights unreliable areas (low texture, reflections, lighting extremes, or object edges).

\subsubsection{Depth Normalization}

Raw depth is normalized:

\begin{equation}
D_{norm}(x,y) = \frac{D_{raw}(x,y) - D_{\min}}{D_{\max} - D_{\min}}
\label{eq:depth_normalization}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Lightweight Object Detection}

\subsubsection{YOLOv8}

YOLOv8n~\cite{jocher2023ultralytics} is used for edge-friendly detection, focusing on relevant classes:

\begin{equation}
C_{relevant} = \{\text{person}, \text{bicycle}, \text{car}, \text{motorcycle}, \text{bus}, \text{truck}\}
\label{eq:relevant_classes}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Filtering}

Detections are filtered and dilated:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Obstacle Detection Filtering}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Detections $B_{raw}$, threshold $\tau_c$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Obstacles $B_{obs}$
\STATE $B_{obs} = \{\}$
\FOR{$b \in B_{raw}$}
    \IF{$b.class \in C_{relevant}$ AND $b.confidence > \tau_c$}
        \STATE $B_{obs}.add(\text{DilateBox}(b, \alpha_{dilation}))$
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $B_{obs}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

$\alpha_{dilation} = 0.1$ ensures conservative margins.

\subsection{Uncertainty-Guided Fusion}

\subsubsection{Confidence Segmentation}

Regions are split by uncertainty:

\begin{equation}
R_{confidence}(x,y) =
\begin{cases}
\text{HIGH} & \sigma_D(x,y) < \tau_{uncertainty} \\
\text{LOW} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:confidence_segmentation}
\end{equation}

with $\tau_{uncertainty} = 0.3$.

\subsubsection{Fusion Algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Adaptive Fusion}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Depth $D$, uncertainty $\sigma_D$, detections $B$, threshold $\tau_u$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Obstacle map $L$
\STATE $R_{high} = (\sigma_D < \tau_u)$
\STATE $L_{depth} = 1 - D_{norm}$; clip to [$d_{min}, d_{max}$]
\STATE $L_{det} = \text{RasterizeDetections}(B)$
\STATE $L = R_{high} \odot L_{depth} + \neg R_{high} \odot L_{det}$
\STATE $L = \text{GaussianBlur}(L, \sigma_{smooth})$
\RETURN $L$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

$d_{min}=0.4$, $d_{max}=0.8$.

\subsubsection{Optimizations}
\begin{itemize}
\item 50\% resolution + bilinear upsampling
\item 5$\times$5 Gaussian smoothing
\item Frame-level LRU caching
\item NumPy-optimized ops
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Navigation Decision Framework}

\subsubsection{Forward Path}

Navigation region:

\begin{equation}
R_{nav} = \{(x,y): 0.3W \leq x \leq 0.7W, 0.6H \leq y \leq H\}
\label{eq:navigation_region_detailed}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Obstacle Density}

\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{\sum_{(x,y) \in R_{nav}} L(x,y)}{|R_{nav}|}
\label{eq:obstacle_density_detailed}
\end{equation}

Threshold $\tau_{nav}=0.4$.

\subsubsection{Decision Logic}

\begin{equation}
Decision =
\begin{cases}
\text{SAFE\_FORWARD} & \rho < \tau_{nav}, \ \sigma_{avg} < \tau_{conf} \\
\text{CAUTION\_FORWARD} & \rho < \tau_{nav}, \ \sigma_{avg} \geq \tau_{conf} \\
\text{STOP\_TURN} & \rho \geq \tau_{nav}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:navigation_decision_detailed}
\end{equation}

$\tau_{conf}=0.35$.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

\subsubsection{Evolution Metrics}

\texttt{EvolutionMetricsLogger} tracks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Navigation: accuracy, safety rates
\item Performance: timing, FPS, memory
\item Quality: depth, detection confidence
\item Environment: density
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ground Truth Validation}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Safety Assessment}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Density $\rho$, detections $N_{det}$, confidence $c_{avg}$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} $GT_{safe}$
\STATE $unsafe = (\rho>0.35) \lor (N_{det}\geq2 \land c_{avg}>0.6) \lor (N_{det}=1 \land c_{avg}>0.8)$
\STATE $GT_{safe} = \neg unsafe$
\RETURN $GT_{safe}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
