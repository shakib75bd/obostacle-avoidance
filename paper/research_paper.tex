\section{Introduction}

Autonomous navigation systems require robust perception capabilities to safely navigate complex environments while maintaining real-time performance constraints. Traditional obstacle detection approaches rely primarily on expensive sensor suites including LiDAR, stereo cameras, and radar systems. However, the growing demand for cost-effective autonomous solutions has driven research toward monocular vision-based approaches that can achieve comparable performance with significantly reduced hardware requirements.

The fundamental challenge in monocular obstacle detection lies in the inherent depth ambiguity of single-camera systems. Unlike stereo vision or LiDAR, monocular cameras cannot directly measure distance to objects, requiring sophisticated depth estimation algorithms that introduce uncertainty and computational overhead. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled impressive monocular depth estimation capabilities, but the reliability of these estimations varies significantly across different image regions and environmental conditions.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel uncertainty-guided adaptive region fusion approach that intelligently combines monocular depth estimation with object detection to create robust obstacle maps for autonomous navigation. Our system makes three key contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Uncertainty-Guided Fusion}: A novel adaptive region fusion algorithm that dynamically weights depth information and object detection based on local uncertainty estimates, improving robustness in challenging conditions.

\item \textbf{Real-Time Navigation Decisions}: A lightweight navigation decision framework optimized for real-time obstacle avoidance with comprehensive safety metrics including false safe and false unsafe rate tracking.

\item \textbf{Comprehensive Performance Analysis}: An extensive evaluation framework comparing navigation-specific metrics rather than traditional computer vision metrics, providing insights relevant to autonomous driving applications.
\end{enumerate}

The proposed system achieves navigation decision accuracy between 45--65\% while maintaining processing speeds of 20--30 FPS on consumer hardware. Most importantly, the system demonstrates a false safe rate below 5\%, meeting critical safety requirements for autonomous navigation applications.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Monocular Depth Estimation}

The field of monocular depth estimation has undergone significant evolution, transitioning from traditional geometric approaches to modern deep learning solutions. This progression reflects a fundamental shift in how depth information is extracted from single images.

\subsubsection{Traditional Geometric Approaches}
Early methods relied heavily on handcrafted features and geometric assumptions. Saxena et~al.~\cite{saxena2009make3d} pioneered the Make3D framework, which decomposed scenes into small superpixels and used Markov Random Fields (MRF) to enforce global consistency. Their approach demonstrated several key advantages:

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Our approach prioritizes immediate obstacle avoidance while maintaining computational efficiency, targeting scenarios where rapid deployment and instant operation are critical. This design philosophy acknowledges the complementary nature of SLAM and reactive avoidance while optimizing for real-world deployment constraints.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{System Architecture and Design Philosophy}

Our obstacle avoidance system is built on a modular architecture that prioritizes real-time performance while maintaining high accuracy for safety-critical navigation decisions. The system design follows a layered approach where each component can operate independently while contributing to the overall navigation decision pipeline.

\figref{fig:architecture} illustrates the complete system pipeline, which processes input images through four main stages: preprocessing and input handling, parallel depth and object detection, uncertainty-guided adaptive fusion, and navigation decision generation. This architecture enables efficient parallel processing while maintaining strict real-time constraints.

\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth,height=0.85\textheight,keepaspectratio]{system_architecture.png}
\caption{System architecture showing the integration of MiDaS depth estimation, YOLOv8 object detection, and uncertainty-guided adaptive region fusion for real-time obstacle avoidance. The modular design enables parallel processing and efficient resource utilization across multiple computational devices (MPS/CUDA acceleration). The pipeline processes input frames through depth estimation and object detection pathways simultaneously, with uncertainty maps guiding the adaptive fusion process to generate robust obstacle maps for navigation decisions. The architecture supports various deployment scenarios from consumer hardware (MacBook Air M1) to edge computing systems (NVIDIA Jetson TX2).}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The system operates at a target resolution of 320$\times$240 pixels, chosen through extensive performance analysis to balance computational efficiency with sufficient spatial detail for reliable obstacle detection. This resolution enables real-time processing on consumer hardware while maintaining adequate information density for navigation decisions.

\subsection{Input Processing and Video Pipeline}

\subsubsection{Video Source Management}

Our system implements a robust video input pipeline capable of handling multiple input sources through the \texttt{VideoSource} class in \texttt{utils/video.py}. The implementation supports:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Webcam Input}: Real-time processing with automatic camera detection and optimization
\item \textbf{Video File Processing}: Offline analysis with frame-accurate processing
\item \textbf{Multi-camera Support}: Selection between different camera sources (built-in, external)
\item \textbf{Adaptive Frame Buffering}: Thread-safe frame capture with queue management
\end{itemize}

The video pipeline implements sophisticated frame skipping algorithms that maintain processing consistency while adapting to available computational resources. Frame skipping is dynamically adjusted based on processing time measurements, ensuring real-time operation under varying computational loads.

\subsubsection{Real-time Performance Optimization}

For real-time applications, our system implements several optimization strategies:

\begin{equation}
t_{frame} = t_{depth} + t_{detection} + t_{fusion} + t_{visualization}
\label{eq:frame_timing}
\end{equation}

where each component is optimized to minimize total frame processing time $t_{frame}$ while maintaining accuracy requirements.

The system employs adaptive processing strategies including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dynamic Monte Carlo Sampling}: Reduces uncertainty samples (1-2) for real-time mode
\item \textbf{Intelligent Caching}: Frame-level caching for repeated processing scenarios
\item \textbf{Resolution Scaling}: Automatic resolution adjustment based on performance requirements
\item \textbf{Component Threading}: Parallel processing where computationally feasible
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monocular Depth Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification}

\subsubsection{MiDaS Network Architecture and Optimization}

Our depth estimation module builds upon the MiDaS-small architecture~\cite{ranftl2020towards}, selected for its optimal balance of accuracy and computational efficiency on resource-constrained hardware. The implementation in \texttt{models/depth\_estimator.py} incorporates several key optimizations:

The MiDaS network processes input images through a ResNet-based encoder-decoder architecture, producing relative depth maps where spatial relationships are preserved:

\begin{equation}
D_{raw}(x,y) = f_{\theta}(I_{norm}(x,y))
\label{eq:midas_forward}
\end{equation}

where $I_{norm}$ represents the normalized input image processed through the MiDaS preprocessing pipeline, and $f_{\theta}$ denotes the complete MiDaS network with learned parameters $\theta$.

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Dropout Implementation}

To address the fundamental uncertainty in monocular depth estimation, we implement Monte Carlo dropout during inference. Unlike traditional approaches that disable dropout during testing, our method maintains dropout activation to obtain uncertainty estimates:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Monte Carlo Uncertainty Estimation}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Image $I$, samples $N$, dropout rate $p$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Mean depth $\mu_D$, uncertainty $\sigma_D$
\STATE Initialize: $depths = []$
\FOR{$i = 1$ to $N$}
    \STATE Enable dropout with rate $p$
    \STATE $D_i = \text{MiDaS}(I)$
    \STATE $depths.append(D_i)$
\ENDFOR
\STATE $\mu_D = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} D_i$
\STATE $\sigma_D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (D_i - \mu_D)^2}$
\RETURN $\mu_D, \sigma_D$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The uncertainty quantification provides crucial information for the adaptive fusion process. High uncertainty regions indicate areas where depth estimates are unreliable, often due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Low texture or uniform regions
\item Reflective or transparent surfaces
\item Extreme lighting conditions
\item Edge effects near object boundaries
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Depth Preprocessing and Normalization}

Raw MiDaS outputs require careful preprocessing to ensure consistent obstacle detection performance:

\begin{equation}
D_{norm}(x,y) = \frac{D_{raw}(x,y) - D_{\min}}{D_{\max} - D_{\min}}
\label{eq:depth_normalization}
\end{equation}

where $D_{\min}$ and $D_{\max}$ represent the minimum and maximum depth values in the current frame, ensuring normalized depth values in the range $[0,1]$.

\subsection{Lightweight Object Detection Module}

\subsubsection{YOLOv8 Architecture and Customization}

Our object detection module employs YOLOv8n \cite{jocher2023ultralytics}, the nano variant optimized for edge deployment. The implementation in \texttt{models/object\_detector.py} incorporates domain-specific optimizations for obstacle detection:

The YOLOv8n architecture processes 320$\times$240 images through a CSPDarknet backbone with FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) neck, producing multi-scale detection outputs. For obstacle avoidance, we focus on detecting relevant object classes:

\begin{equation}
C_{relevant} = \{\text{person}, \text{bicycle}, \text{car}, \text{motorcycle}, \text{bus}, \text{truck}\}
\label{eq:relevant_classes}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Detection Filtering and Post-processing}

Raw YOLO detections undergo multi-stage filtering to ensure relevance for navigation decisions:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Obstacle Detection Filtering}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Raw detections $B_{raw}$, confidence threshold $\tau_c$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Filtered obstacles $B_{obstacles}$
\STATE $B_{obstacles} = \{\}$
\FOR{each detection $b$ in $B_{raw}$}
    \IF{$b.class \in C_{relevant}$ AND $b.confidence > \tau_c$}
        \STATE $b_{dilated} = \text{DilateBox}(b, \alpha_{dilation})$
        \STATE $B_{obstacles}.add(b_{dilated})$
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $B_{obstacles}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The dilation factor $\alpha_{dilation} = 0.1$ accounts for detection uncertainty and ensures conservative obstacle boundaries, critical for safety in autonomous navigation.

\subsection{Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Region Fusion}

\subsubsection{Confidence Region Segmentation}

The core innovation of our approach lies in the dynamic segmentation of image regions based on depth estimation uncertainty. This segmentation enables optimal utilization of available information sources:

\begin{equation}
R_{confidence}(x,y) = \begin{cases}
\text{HIGH} & \text{if } \sigma_D(x,y) < \tau_{uncertainty} \\
\text{LOW} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:confidence_segmentation}
\end{equation}

The uncertainty threshold $\tau_{uncertainty} = 0.3$ was determined through extensive empirical analysis across diverse environmental conditions, balancing conservative depth usage with detection coverage.

\subsubsection{Adaptive Fusion Algorithm}

Our adaptive fusion algorithm operates on the principle of information reliability, dynamically weighting depth and detection information based on local confidence estimates:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Fusion}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Depth $D$, uncertainty $\sigma_D$, detections $B$, threshold $\tau_u$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Obstacle likelihood map $L_{obstacle}$
\STATE $R_{high} = (\sigma_D < \tau_u)$
\STATE $R_{low} = \neg R_{high}$
\STATE \textbf{// Process high-confidence regions}
\STATE $L_{depth} = 1 - D_{norm}$ \textbf{// Invert for obstacle likelihood}
\STATE $L_{depth}[D_{norm} < d_{min} \text{ OR } D_{norm} > d_{max}] = 0$
\STATE \textbf{// Process low-confidence regions}
\STATE $L_{detection} = \text{RasterizeDetections}(B)$
\STATE \textbf{// Combine based on confidence}
\STATE $L_{obstacle} = R_{high} \odot L_{depth} + R_{low} \odot L_{detection}$
\STATE $L_{obstacle} = \text{GaussianBlur}(L_{obstacle}, \sigma_{smooth})$
\RETURN $L_{obstacle}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The depth range parameters $d_{min} = 0.4$ and $d_{max} = 0.8$ define the relevant obstacle detection zone, filtering out noise from very close or distant objects that are less relevant for navigation decisions.

\subsubsection{Obstacle Map Generation and Optimization}

The obstacle map generation process in \texttt{models/obstacle\_map.py} implements several optimizations for real-time performance:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Resolution Scaling}: Processing at 50\% resolution with bilinear upsampling
\item \textbf{Gaussian Smoothing}: 5$\times$5 kernel with $\sigma = 1.0$ for noise reduction
\item \textbf{Result Caching}: Frame-level caching with LRU eviction policy
\item \textbf{Vectorized Operations}: NumPy-optimized array operations for efficiency
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Navigation Decision Framework}

\subsubsection{Forward Path Analysis}

Navigation decisions are based on obstacle density analysis within a critical forward navigation region. This region is defined as the area most relevant for immediate navigation decisions:

\begin{equation}
R_{navigation} = \{(x,y) : 0.3W \leq x \leq 0.7W \text{ and } 0.6H \leq y \leq H\}
\label{eq:navigation_region_detailed}
\end{equation}

This region captures the immediate forward path while excluding peripheral areas that are less critical for navigation decisions. The choice of dimensions (40\% width, 40\% height) is based on typical vehicle kinematics and stopping distances.

\subsubsection{Obstacle Density Calculation and Thresholding}

The navigation decision algorithm computes obstacle density within the critical region and applies threshold-based decision logic:

\begin{equation}
\rho_{obstacle} = \frac{\sum_{(x,y) \in R_{nav}} L_{obstacle}(x,y)}{|R_{nav}|}
\label{eq:obstacle_density_detailed}
\end{equation}

The navigation threshold $\tau_{nav} = 0.4$ represents a critical decision boundary determined through safety analysis. Values below this threshold indicate safe forward movement, while higher values suggest path obstruction requiring alternative navigation strategies.

\subsubsection{Safety-Critical Decision Logic}

Our navigation decision framework prioritizes safety over efficiency, implementing conservative decision policies:

\begin{equation}
Decision_{nav} = \begin{cases}
\text{SAFE\_FORWARD} & \text{if } \rho_{obstacle} < \tau_{nav} \text{ and } \sigma_{avg} < \tau_{conf} \\
\text{CAUTION\_FORWARD} & \text{if } \rho_{obstacle} < \tau_{nav} \text{ and } \sigma_{avg} \geq \tau_{conf} \\
\text{STOP\_TURN} & \text{if } \rho_{obstacle} \geq \tau_{nav}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:navigation_decision_detailed}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{avg}$ represents the average uncertainty in the navigation region, and $\tau_{conf} = 0.35$ defines the confidence threshold for cautious navigation.

\subsection{Performance Metrics and Evaluation Framework}

\subsubsection{Evolution Metrics Logging}

Our system implements comprehensive performance logging through the \texttt{EvolutionMetricsLogger} class in \texttt{test\_video.py}. This logging framework captures frame-by-frame performance data for detailed analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Navigation Metrics}: Decision accuracy, false safe/unsafe rates
\item \textbf{Performance Metrics}: Component timing, FPS, memory usage
\item \textbf{Quality Metrics}: Depth quality, detection confidence, uncertainty levels
\item \textbf{Environmental Metrics}: Obstacle density, scene complexity
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ground Truth Generation and Validation}

For evaluation purposes, we implement a sophisticated ground truth generation system that combines heuristic analysis with safety assessment:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Ground Truth Safety Assessment}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Obstacle density $\rho$, detection count $N_{det}$, confidence $c_{avg}$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Ground truth safety $GT_{safe}$
\STATE $unsafe_{density} = (\rho > 0.35)$
\STATE $unsafe_{detection} = (N_{det} \geq 2 \text{ AND } c_{avg} > 0.6)$
\STATE $unsafe_{confidence} = (N_{det} = 1 \text{ AND } c_{avg} > 0.8)$
\STATE $GT_{safe} = \neg(unsafe_{density} \text{ OR } unsafe_{detection} \text{ OR } unsafe_{confidence})$
\RETURN $GT_{safe}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This ground truth generation enables quantitative evaluation of navigation decision accuracy and safety performance across diverse scenarios.

\section{Experimental Setup and Implementation}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Validation of Hypotheses}

\subsubsection{Primary Hypothesis Validation}

Our primary hypothesis that uncertainty-guided adaptive fusion improves navigation accuracy compared to single-modal approaches is strongly supported by the experimental results. The 7.4\% improvement over detection-only and 13.1\% improvement over depth-only approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive multi-modal fusion.

\subsubsection{Secondary Hypothesis Validation}

The secondary hypothesis regarding computational feasibility for real-time applications is validated by the 24.5 FPS performance on consumer hardware. This frame rate exceeds the typical requirements for autonomous navigation (15-20 FPS) while providing enhanced safety through uncertainty quantification.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art}

\subsubsection{Advantages over Traditional SLAM}

Compared to traditional SLAM approaches, our system offers several advantages:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: 2--3$\times$ faster processing for obstacle avoidance tasks
\item \textbf{Reduced Complexity}: No map maintenance or loop closure requirements
\item \textbf{Immediate Deployment}: No initialization or mapping phase required
\item \textbf{Memory Efficiency}: Constant memory usage regardless of environment size
\item \textbf{Robustness}: No cumulative error accumulation over time
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Complementary to Existing Systems}

Rather than replacing comprehensive SLAM systems, our approach provides a complementary capability:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Safety Layer}: Additional safety system for SLAM-based navigation
\item \textbf{Fallback System}: Backup navigation when SLAM fails or is unavailable
\item \textbf{Real-time Safety}: Immediate obstacle detection without mapping delays
\item \textbf{Resource Optimization}: Efficient use of available computational resources
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Insights and Best Practices}

\subsubsection{Development Methodology}

The iterative development approach provided several insights:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Modular Testing}: Component-level validation essential for complex systems
\item \textbf{Performance Profiling}: Continuous optimization throughout development lifecycle
\item \textbf{Safety-First Design}: Conservative defaults with configurable aggressiveness
\item \textbf{Visualization Integration}: Real-time visualization crucial for development and debugging
\item \textbf{Configuration Management}: Flexible parameter systems enable diverse deployment scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Deployment Considerations}

Practical deployment requires consideration of several factors:

\item \textbf{Performance Monitoring}: Real-time performance tracking for system health
\item \textbf{Graceful Degradation}: Fallback behaviors for component failures
\item \textbf{Update Mechanisms}: Safe system updates without service interruption
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advantages of Uncertainty-Guided Fusion}

The experimental results demonstrate several key advantages of our uncertainty-guided adaptive fusion approach:

\textbf{Improved Safety}: The 3.4\% reduction in false safe rate compared to detection-only baselines represents a significant improvement in safety-critical scenarios. This improvement is achieved through intelligent fusion that leverages depth information where reliable and falls back to object detection in uncertain regions.

\textbf{Robust Performance}: Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single modalities, our adaptive fusion provides robustness across diverse environmental conditions. The system automatically adapts to scenarios where depth estimation is unreliable (e.g., low-texture regions, lighting variations) by emphasizing object detection information.

\textbf{Real-Time Feasibility}: Despite the additional computational overhead of uncertainty quantification, the system maintains real-time performance (20-30 FPS) suitable for autonomous navigation applications.

\subsection{Limitations and Challenges}

Several limitations should be acknowledged:

\textbf{Relative Depth}: MiDaS produces relative rather than metric depth, requiring careful calibration for absolute distance estimation. Our obstacle detection approach mitigates this limitation by focusing on obstacle likelihood rather than precise distance measurements.

\textbf{Monte Carlo Overhead}: Uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout introduces computational overhead. However, our experiments demonstrate that even 2-3 samples provide sufficient uncertainty estimates for effective fusion.

\textbf{Ground Truth Challenges}: The lack of comprehensive ground truth datasets for monocular obstacle avoidance evaluation limits quantitative analysis. Our heuristic-based ground truth generation provides reasonable evaluation but may not capture all edge cases.

\subsection{Future Directions}

Several directions for future research emerge from this work:

\textbf{Temporal Integration}: Incorporating temporal information could improve stability and reduce noise in navigation decisions. Video-based approaches could leverage motion cues for enhanced obstacle detection.

\textbf{Adaptive Thresholds}: Dynamic adjustment of uncertainty and navigation thresholds based on environmental conditions could further improve performance.

\textbf{Multi-Scale Analysis}: Processing multiple resolution scales could provide better trade-offs between computational efficiency and detection accuracy.

\textbf{Edge Deployment}: Optimization for edge computing platforms (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, mobile processors) would enable broader deployment in autonomous systems.

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Research Impact}

This work contributes to uncertainty quantification in autonomous systems through practical Monte Carlo dropout implementation, multi-modal sensor fusion via uncertainty-guided adaptive strategies, and autonomous navigation safety through conservative decision-making with minimal performance impact (15\% computational overhead for uncertainty estimation).
